									<h2 class="section-title">1) Android Studio on Windows </h2>
									<br>
									<div class="section-block">
									<p>To install Android Studio on Windows, proceed as follows:</p>
								
									<p>I launched android-studio-bundle-143.2821654-windows.exe to start the installation process. The installer responded by presenting the Android Studio Setup dialog box shown in Figure 1.</p>
									<img src="assets/img/b.png">
									<p>Figure 2. Do you want to install the Android SDK and AVD?</p>

									<p>The next dialog box invites you to change the installation locations for Android Studio and the Android SDK.</p>

									<p>Figure 4. Set the Android Studio and Android SDK installation locations </p>

									<p>Change the location or accept the default locations and click Next. The installer defaults to creating a shortcut for launching this program, or you can choose to decline. I recommend that you create the shortcut, then click the Install button to begin installation. </p>

									<img src="assets/img/e.png">
									<p>Figure 5. Create a new shortcut for Android Studio </p>
									<p>The resulting dialog box shows the progress of installing Android Studio and the Android SDK. Clicking the Show Details button will let you view detailed information about the installation progress.The dialog box will inform you when installation has finished.

									<p>On your first run, you'll be asked to respond to several configuration-oriented dialog boxes. The first dialog box focuses on importing settings from any previously installed version of Android Studio.</p>
									</div>
									<img src="assets/img/h.png">
									<p>Figure 8. Import settings </p>
									<p>If you're like me, and don't have a previously installed version, you can just keep the default setting and click OK. Android Studio will respond with a slightly enhanced version of the splash screen, followed by the Android Studio Setup Wizard dialog box:</p>

									<img src="assets/img/i.png">
									<p>Figure 9. Validate your Android SDK and development environment setup</p>
									<p>When you click Next, the setup wizard invites you to select an installation type for your SDK components. For now I recommend you keep the default standard setting.</p>

										<p>You'll use this dialog to start up a new Android Studio project, work with an existing project, and more. You can access it anytime by double-clicking the Android Studio shortcut on your desktop. </p>

										<h6>Your first Android Studio mobile app</h6>
										<p>The quickest way to get to know Android Studio is to use it to develop an app. We'll start with a variation on the "Hello, World" application: a little mobile app that displays a "Welcome to Android" message. In the steps that follow, you'll start a new Android Studio project and get to know the project workspace, including the project editor that you'll use to code the app in Part 2. </p>

										<h6>Starting a new project</h6>
										<p>From our setup so far, you should still have Android Studio running with the Welcome to Android Studio dialog box. From here, click Start a new Android Studio project. Android Studio will respond with the Create New Project dialog box shown in Figure 15. </p>

										<img src="assets/img/o.png">
										<p>Figure 15. Create a new project </p>
										<p>Enter W2A (Welcome to Android) as the application name and javajeff.ca as the company domain name. You should then see C:\Users\jeffrey\AndroidStudioProjects\W2A as the project location. Click Next to select your target devices. </p>
										<img src="assets/img/p.png">
										<p>Figure 16. Select your target device categories </p>
										<p>Android Studio lets you select form factors, or categories of target devices, for every app you create. I would have preferred to keep the default API 15: Android 4.0.3 (IceCreamSandwich) minimum SDK setting (under Phone and Tablet), which is supported by my Amazon Kindle Fire HD tablet. Because Android Studio doesn't currently support this API level (even when you add the 4.0.3 system image via the SDK Manager), I changed this setting to API 14: Android 4.0 (IceCreamSandwich), which is also supported by my tablet. Click Next, and you will be given the opportunity to choose a template for your app's main activity. For now we'll stick with Empty Activity. Select this template and click Next. </p>


										<img src="assets/img/q.png">
										<p>Figure 17. Specify an activity template</p>
										<p>Next you'll customize the activity:</p>

										<img src="assets/img/r.png">
										<p>Figure 18. Customize your activity</p>
										<p>Figure 18. Customize your activity Enter W2A as the activity name and main as the layout name, and click Finish to complete this step. Android Studio will respond that it is creating the project, then take you to the project workspace. </p>
										<img src="assets/img/s.png">
										<p>Figure 19. Android Studio workspace</p>
										<br><p>The project workspace is organized around a menu bar, a tool bar, a work area, additional components that lead to more windows (such as a Gradle Console window), and a status bar. Also note the Tip of the Day dialog box, which you can disable if you like. </p>
										<p>Accessing AVD Manager or SDK Manager from menu and tool bar</p>
										<p>To access the traditional AVD Manager or SDK Manager, select Android from the Tools menu followed by AVD Manager or SDK Manager from the resulting pop-up menu (or click their tool bar icons).</p>
										<p>The project and editor windows</p>
										<p>When you enter the project workspace, W2A is identified as the current project, but you won't immediately see the project details. After a few moments, these details will appear in two new windows.</p>

										<img src="assets/img/t.png">
										<p>Figure 20. The project and editor windows</p>
										<p>The project window is organized into a tree whose main branches are App and Gradle Scripts. The App branch is further organized into manifests, java, and res subbranches: </p>
										<p>• manifests stores AndroidManifest.xml, which is an XML file that describes the structure of an Android app. This file also records permission settings (where applicable) and other details about the app.</p>
										<p>• java stores an app's Java source files according to a package hierarchy, which is ca.javajeff.w2a in this example.</p>• res stores an app's resource files, which are organized into drawable, layout, mipmap, and values subbranches:
										<p>• res stores an app's resource files, which are organized into drawable, layout, mipmap, and values subbranches:</p>
										<p>• drawable: an initially empty location in which to store an app's artwork• layout: a location containing an app's layout files; initially, main.xml(the main activity's layout file) is stored here.</p>
										<p>• mipmap: a location containing various ic_launcher.png files that store launcher screen icons of different resolutions</p>
										<p>• values: a location containing colors.xml, dimens.xml, strings.xml, and styles.xml The Gradle Scripts branch identifies various .gradle (such as build.gradle) and .properties (such as local.properties) files that are used by the Gradle-based build system.</p>

										<br>
										<p>Branch names and directory/file names</p>
										<p>Each branch/sub-branch corresponds to a directory name or to a file name. For example, res corresponds to the res directory and strings.xml corresponds to the strings.xml file.</p>

										<div class="section-block">
											<p>Add Firebase to Your Android Project</p>
											<p>Prerequisites</p>
											<br><p>A device running Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or newer, and Google Play services 15.0.0 or higher.</p>
											<p>The latest version of Android Studio</p>

											<br>
											<p>If you don't have an Android Studio project already, you can download one of our quickstart samples if you just want to try a Firebase feature. If you're using a quickstart, remember to get the application ID from the build. Gradle file in your project's module folder (typically app/), as you'll need this package name for the next step.</p>

											<h6>Add Firebase to your app</h6>
											<br><p>If you're using Android Studio version 2.2 or later, the Firebase Assistant is the simplest way to connect your app to Firebase. The Assistant can connect your existing project or create a new one for you with all the necessary gradle dependencies. </p>
											<p>If you're using an older version of Android Studio or have a more complex project configuration, you can still manually add Firebase to your app.</p>
											<h6>Manually add Firebase</h6>
											<p>Before You Setup firebase account you should generate SHA1 key in Android Studio. </p>
											<p>Follow this below Steps to generate SHA1 key</p>
											<ul>
												
												<li>Open Android Studio</li>
												<li>Click on gradle</li>
												<li>Click on PetStand Root</li>
												<li>After click on task -> Android -> SigninReport </li>
												<li>You will get SHA1 Key </li>

											</ul>
											<img src="assets/img/SHA1.png">
											<p>For Firebase setup open this link and login with gmail account - Link - https://firebase.google.com/ and Goto Console</p>
											<p>It's time to add Firebase to your app. To do this you'll need a Firebase project and a Firebase configuration file for your app.</p>
											<br><p>To create a Firebase project:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console, if you don't already have one. Click Add project. If you already have an existing Google project associated with your mobile app, select it from the Project name drop down menu. Otherwise, enter a project name to create a new project.</li>
												<li>Optional: Edit your Project ID. Your project is given a unique ID automatically, and it's used in publicly visible Firebase features such as database URLs and your Firebase Hosting subdomain. You can change it now if you want to use a specific subdomain.</li>
												<li>Follow the remaining setup steps and click Create project (or Add Firebase if you're using an existing project) to begin provisioning resources for your project. This typically takes a few minutes. When the process completes, you'll be taken to the project overview.</li>
											</ul>

											<img src="assets/img/firebase-new-1.png">
											<br>
											<p>Enter all Details in firebase setting and Also SHA1 key to configure firebase and follow below steps.</p>
											<img src="assets/img/android-fb-json.png">
											<br>
											<p>Use the Firebase Assistant</p>

												</li>
												<li>Click to expand one of the listed features (for example, Analytics), then click the provided tutorial link (for example, Log an Analytics event).</li>
												<li>Click the Connect to Firebase button to connect to Firebase and add the necessary code to your app.</li>
											</ul>

											<br>
											<h6>Now that you have a project, you can add your Android app to it:</h6>
											<ol>
												<li>Click Add Firebase to your Android app and follow the setup steps. If you're importing an existing Google project, this may happen automatically and you can just download the config file.</li>
												<li>When prompted, enter your app's package name. It's important to enter the package name your app is using; this can only be set when you add an app to your Firebase project.</li>
												<li>During the process, you'll download a google-services.json file. You can download this file again at any time.</li>
												<li>After you add the initialization code, run your app to send verification to the Firebase console that you've successfully installed Firebase.</li>
											</ol>

											<h6>Add the SDK</h6>
											<p>If you would like to integrate the Firebase libraries into one of your own projects, you need to perform a few basic tasks to prepare your Android Studio project. You may have already done this as part of adding Firebase to your app.</p>
											<p>First, add rules to your root-level build.gradle file, to include the google-services plugin and the Google's Maven repository:</p>
											<img src="assets/img/firebase1.png">
											<p>Then, in your module Gradle file (usually the app/build.gradle), add the apply plugin line at the bottom of the file to enable the Gradle plugin:</p>
											<img src="assets/img/firebase2.png">
											<p>You should also add the dependencies for the Firebase SDKs you want to use. We recommend starting with com.google.firebase:firebase-core, which provides Google Analytics for Firebase functionality. See the list of available libraries.</p>
											<br>
											<p>In this App firebase is already integrated you can generate google-services.json on firebase console https://firebase.google.com/</p>
											<p>After going to this given website follow these steps :</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Click on go to console</li>
												<li>sign in with your google account</li>
												<li>add project</li>
												<li>generate google-services.json</li>
												<li>Replace with given file in screeshot</li>
